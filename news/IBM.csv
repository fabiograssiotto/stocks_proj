Obama discussed strategy for how to overcome domestic political angst over the TPP with Kasich, who fell short in his bid to be the Republican presidential candidate, and arranged for him to speak with reporters afterward from the White House briefing room lectern. The unusual move was a sign of how the White House intends to make a final full-court push to persuade Republican leaders in the U.S. Congress to approve the deal in a ""lame duck"" session after the Nov. 8 election, where the TPP has been pilloried by both Republican and Democratic candidates.",IBM,Obama enlists Republican Kasich to strategize on TPP passage,http://finance.yahoo.com/news/obama-enlists-republican-kasich-strategize-152959256.html
