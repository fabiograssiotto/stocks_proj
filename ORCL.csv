The deal was announced July 28th as a tender offer, in which Oracle must get NetSuite holders to tender a majority of the shares outstanding, and it has always been clouded by the fact that Oracle founder and executive chairman Larry Ellison is the stock’s biggest shareholder. Oracle says it’s wiling to drop the bid, ""In the event that a majority of NetSuite’s unaffiliated shareholders do not tender sufficient shares to reach the minimum tender condition, Oracle will respect the will of NetSuite’s unaffiliated shareholders and terminate its proposed acquisition.""
