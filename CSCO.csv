Among the details of last quarter’s report, Cisco’s switching sales, 28% of its revenue, fell 9%, year over year, which will fuel concerns of the bears that the company continues to lose share to Arista Networks (ANET) and Juniper Networks (JNPR).",CSCO,Cisco to Change Reporting Into Five Categories to 'Better Align with Evolving Biz Model',http://finance.yahoo.com/r/011c4e06-e1f9-3ee5-bdbd-d2caf990ba57/cisco-to-change-reporting-into-five-categories-to-better-align-with-evolving-biz-model-1502918224?mod=yahoobarrons&ru=yahoo&yptr=yahoo&.tsrc=rss

Wells Fargo’s Jess Lubert, who has an Outperform rating on Arista stock, and a $106 to $114 “valuation range,” thinks that routing is “the next big driver of potential upside” for the company and its shares. The Street consensus for Arista doesn’t yet reflect what Lubert thinks may be $100 million in routing sales in 2017, and $300 million annually by 2019, thanks to ""superior performance and cost of the company’s R-series lineup."" One key is that Arista can leverage its existing base of customers for its network switches to also sell routers, he concludes: The cloud vertical may currently accounts for roughly ~17% of total industry routing sales or a little more than $1.6B worth of revenue in 2016.",CSCO,"Arista's Routing to Steal Cisco, Juniper Share, Says Wells",http://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2016/12/12/aristas-routing-to-steal-cisco-juniper-share-says-wells/?mod=yahoobarrons&ru=yahoo
