Nvidia’s being the “winner” in A.I. is “not a foregone conclusion,” writes Davuluri, quoting from Conan Doyle’s “The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,” in which the detective advises ""There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact.” That quote ""aptly describes our view on Nvidia’s implied dominance in artificial intelligence."" In a market for so-called “accelerator” chips, which include Nvidia’s GPUs, but also FPGAs from Intel, and from Xilinx (XLNX), and which may reach $20 billion in value by 2021, ""Nvidia is well positioned to continue benefiting from the burgeoning AI phenomenon,” concedes Davuluri.",INTC,"Intel Can Beat Nvidia in 'Inference' of A.I., Says Morningstar",http://finance.yahoo.com/r/5ca99a7e-886a-3f29-a276-2a91a57c9572/intel-can-beat-nvidia-in-inference-of-a-i-says-morningstar-1504298887?mod=yahoobarrons&ru=yahoo&yptr=yahoo&.tsrc=rss

Morgan’s Rod Hall this morning raised his rating on the shares to Overweight from Neutral, with a $68 price target, writing that there is “fundamental upside given the expected closure of the NXPI acquisition by the end of this year,"" referring to the pending acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI).  Despite the company’s ongoing tussle with Apple (AAPL), which has compelled its own contract manufacturers to stop paying royalties owed to Qualcomm, Hall thinks that the “valuation gap is too large” given the NXP deal.  Regarding the dispute, it’s likely to result in “incremental discounting” of Qualcomm’s royalty rate, but that alone shouldn’t deter investing in the stock:  While we acknowledge that Apple’s attack has been broader than we have seen with other disputes we believe it is ultimately in Apple’s interest to complete a new deal with Qualcomm.",INTC,"Qualcomm Rising: Look Past Apple Battle to NXP, Says J P Morgan",http://finance.yahoo.com/r/b4b4faa4-1e24-3676-ad11-2a4f179eaf2f/qualcomm-rising-look-past-apple-battle-to-nxp-says-j-p-morgan-1495466087?mod=yahoobarrons&ru=yahoo&yptr=yahoo&.tsrc=rss

Following this morning's call, Krzanich was on CNBC with anchor Jon Fortt. Susquehanna’s Christopher Rolland, who has a “Positive” rating on Intel shares, nevertheless writes in a note to clients that ""We remain skeptical on the deal's LT value creation given Intel's acquisition history and mobility in this rapidly changing market.""

Analysts have begun pushing out notes on the matter after Intel’s CEO, Brian Krzanich, held a conference call with the Street at 8:30 Eastern Time. Krzanich said Intel intended to become “the global leader in autonomous driving,” which he described as a $70 billion market as self-driving cars reach “levels 3 and 4” of autonomy, and even opined the market could become a $100 billion market with the prospect of “incremental opportunities.” He said there was “real overlap” between Intel and Mobileye that helped justify the purchase: “We saw significant duplication in what it is we were trying to do relative to the capabilities that Mobileye already had.""

Noting the company’s fiscal Q3 report last Thursday, which drove the stock up 30% on Friday — “It was the best quarter of any company of 2016,” he said — Cramer remarked that the data center and machine learning trends that are expanding the company’s profile beyond gaming are a multi-year set of trends that will make the company just as central as Intel was to PCs."" Cramer conceded the one knock against Nvidia stock, as he sees it, is valuation, but quickly added that it wouldn’t matter in the long term because, as he put it, “The Intel of your generation is Nvidia!"" Nvidia shares today closed up $2.55, or 3%, at $86.19.",INTC,'The Intel Of Your Generation is Nvidia!'

Rolland, who has a “Positive” rating on Intel stock, yesterday raised his price target to $45 from $42 after concluding Intel may have come up with a technology that “could be one of the most important of our generation."" Today, Rolland hosted a conference call with one professor Wim Bogaerts of Ghent University, whom he describes as ""a global thought leader in silicon photonics.” Rolland has not yet released a new note since that call, though I would expect to see one any moment now.

Rolland is Neutral on Knowles (KN), Applied Micro Circuits (AMCC), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Marvell Technology Group (MRVL), and Nvidia (NVDA). Rolland breaks up his coverage into two categories of chips, “compute,” including Intel and Cavium and AMD and Nvidia, and “broad-based semiconductors."" His view on compute is that PCs aren’t as bad as people think, the data center is a huge growth opportunity, and GPU chips of the sort AMD and Nvidia sell are also very promising, but that this is already baked into shares of those two companies: The Compute related semiconductors are a tale of two markets, PC and the data center.",INTC,"Cavium, Intel, Broadcom Stars of Susquehanna Initiation",http://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2016/09/20/cavium-intel-broadcom-stars-of-susquehanna-initiation/?mod=yahoobarrons&ru=yahoo

As Intel’s Zane Ball, head of the chip maker’s “technology and manufacturing group” explains, chip companies that come to Intel can use ARM’s “Artisan physical IP”when they have chips made with Intel’s forthcoming manufacturing process, which makes parts with measurements of 10 billionths of a meter, or “10-nano,” as it’s called. The patents that ARM brings to the party, Ball notes, include so-called POP-IP, which is “for future ARM premium mobile cores.” In a simultaneous blog post by ARM’s Will Abbey, ARM explains that “the initial POP IP will be for two future advanced ARM Cortex-A processor cores designed for mobile computing applications in either ARM big.LITTLE™ or stand-alone configurations.” He further goes on to say that Intel joins the collection of other chip manufacturers who all partner with ARM, giving ARM’s licensees more options for manufacturing their parts.",INTC,Intel: Hell Freezes Over with ARM Partnership for Chip Manufacturing,http://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2016/08/16/intel-hell-freezes-over-with-arm-partnership-for-chip-manufacturing/?mod=yahoobarrons&ru=yahoo
